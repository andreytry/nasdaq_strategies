As an eperienced Pine Script programmer and nasdaq trader, write me a strategy that enters LONG  when smoothed RSI has local minimum and is below oversold threshold 
and enters SHORT when the smoothed RSI is at its local maximum. Smoothing parameter should be a setting. 
Close LONG when either smoothed RSI is overbought again or it has made a local maximum and reversed more than 10% threshold.
Close short when either the smoothed RSI is oversold again or it has made a local minimum and reversed more than 10% up. 
Before entering position ensure the trend is low or moderate. The trend threshold should be a parameter
